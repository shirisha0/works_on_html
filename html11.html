<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
<p>1Utility: Utility is the foundation of customer needs. The first thing that a buyer
    considers while evaluating a product is whether it satisfies his or her needs or
    not. A product can be successful only if it ensures market acceptance and
    usefulness. Every component of the design should be able to serve a valuable
    purpose. Any aspect of design that is not beneficial to the user can detract
    from the user experience of the product.
    Aesthetically relevant: Aesthetics plays an important role in the future of
    product design. It brings up a positive attitude in the users. The product needs
    to be functional and easy-to-use while at the same time it should possess
    aesthetic power. This is because people want products that do wonders, while
    not looking ugly. Imagine all the Apple fans. The same goes for digital
    products such as software, apps or websites. A designer who wants to keep
    improving and developing skills should never miss out on aesthetic sense.
    Simplicity: As said by German Industrial Designer Dieter Rams, “Good design
    is as little design as possible”. Therefore, simplicity plays a vital role in product
    design as much in life. Crafting something simple and functional allows people
    to immediately understand what the product does and how they can use it. A
    good product designer must always showcase aesthetic ability, functionality
    and instinctive simplicity. Without simplicity, a product will never be able to
    attract consumers</p>
